    "> From this random sample of the term `all`, it seems like Quadeca is going through a hard time. This can be seen in the lines `i feel i need to scream it all all cant even fall i cant leave it all` and `dont think i can cry no more no all of this red on my eyes looking like`. From these lines, it seems like Quadeca needs an escape, but there is nothing he can do. There are also references to a past relationship in the line `its you and me do you love me all you do you love me all you can`. In other uses of the word `all`, we see Quadeca noticing and address critics. We see this in the lines `me thats why i stay fire see huh all of these rappers they wanna be friends but`, `they knowin me so well i been catchin all the shade theyve been throwin im odell uh`, and `feel funny to me its all a game all these people just a number to me and`. Finally, Quadeca also uses the term `all` to brag about how much wealth he as such as in the line `from money huh ah ha i got it all in my bank huh i treat that shit`."

This is emphasized in the line `league so fuck an industry plant ill plant myself in the industry in my own shoes i`. Here Quadeca states that he doesn't need a label to break into the industry and that he'll do it by himself, with his own resources. \n",

This can be seen in the lines `ima hit you back another day yeah i woke up this mornin or should i say afternoon` and `is borin ima fuck up my attitude i woke up this evenin ima have to get back`. These lines can be interpreted either as Quadeca doesn't want to get up from bed as he has no motivation to go on with his day or that every part of the day (morning, afternoon, evening) are the same to him and as a result, he's burnt out from going through the motions. In other uses of the term `woke`, we see Quadeca reminiscing over a past relationship. This can be seen in the line `were just shades of us shades of us woke up on your side of the bed its`. Here Quadeca notes that towards the tail end of his relationship, they were just shades of their original love and now he's waking up on her side of the bed because she is no longer there to occupy it.

This can be seen in the lines `my life is a highlight reel swear my life is a movie red dot on my forehead`, `for a new car looking for a new life new life looking out a new lens uh`, and `in you mm uh everything changed in my life now i got some adjustin to do uh`. In these lines, we can see that Quadeca compares his new life to a movie and as a result, he has a target on his head. This growth in popularity could be a double edge sword because now this perpetuates the need for him to prove himself yet again to the critics and he has to adjust to his new life through a new point of view.\n",

We can see in these lines that Quadeca tried to make a relationship work, but in the end the two just had different life goals. It seems like Quadeca misses his ex-lover and wants her back, but the possibility of her coming back does not seem very likely.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Finally, some other uses of the term `life` are when Quadeca compares himself to other rappers. We can see this in the line `the wrong wrong life you in the wrong life bitch media painted the wrong light huh hard` and `life like a movie huh your life like a clip huh yeah hahahaha i do`. The first line can be interpreted as Quadeca saying that his life is superior and he's a better rapper and that other rappers who are worse than him made the wrong decision to be a rapper. The second line can be interpreted as Quadeca's career will be as long as a movie whereas other rappers' careers will be as long as a clip. In context, the length of a movie is significantly longer than the length of a clip, so Quadeca is saying that he'll have a long lasting career compared to some of these other rappers."

In the first line, we see that Quadeca says that he still wouldn't be happy even if he about to fill up arenas and perform for a million people. This just goes to show that fame and success is not the solution to everything. In the second line, it seems like Quadeca is noticing that he needs someone by his side. This could be in reference to a girlfriend or maybe just friends in general.\n",

We can see this in the lines `exist if you remember me ill only exist if you remember me you are not in love` and `drift away youre a memory ill only exist if you remember me you remember me ill only exist if you`. Here, we can see that Quadeca's relationship is nothing but a memory and it seems like the relationship ended so poorly, that the two people don't exist to each other unless they are forced to remember the relationship. Another interpretation of this could be that Quadeca was so reliant on the relationship that since the relationship is over, his own existence and self-worth is in jeopardy."
