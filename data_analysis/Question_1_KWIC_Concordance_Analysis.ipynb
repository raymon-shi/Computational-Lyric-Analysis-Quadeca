    "From these keywords, it seems that in the From Me To You (2021) album, it definitely shows that Quadeca is talking a lot about a relationship and also about struggling through isolation during the coronavirus pandemic. We see a lot of references to him loving someone and I can only assume that he is talking about his most recently ex-girlfriend. From other contexts, it seems like he was not contributing enough to the relationship due to his workaholic behavior and now they're nothing but  a past memory. Quadeca also seems to be reflecting on his isolation and there are a lot of references to life never being the same as the previous year. The reference can have a double meaning, where he's talking about both the pandemic and also his relationship. There are also a lot of references to climbing a mountain and one of the interesting contexts show that Quadeca has reached a peak in popularity and his skills and that he is afraid of the inevitable drop that comes afterwards.
