## Data Analysis

These are all the notebooks that are related to the data analysis that I performed on Quadeca's lyrics and the Billboard Top 50 Rap charts lyrics.

The `1_Question_1_Word_Freq_N_Gram_Freq_Analysis.ipynb` notebook stores the word frequency and n-gram frequency analysis for comparing Quadeca's earlier music to his later music.

The `2_Question_1_Keyness_and_KWIC_Analysis.ipynb` notebook stores the keyness analysis for each corpus and then those keywords are then used in a keyword in context analysis.

The `3_Question_1_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` notebook stores the sentiment analysis that compares the polarity score of Quadeca's earlier music to the polarity score of Quadeca's later music. 

The `4_Question_2_Word_Frequency_N-Gram_Frequency_Lists.ipynb` notebook stores the word frequency and n-gram frequecy analysis that compares Quadeca's later music to the Billboard Top 50 Rap music for 2018, 2019, and 2020.

The `5_Question_2_Keyness_and_KWIC_Analysis.ipynb` notebook does a keyness analysis between Quadeca's later music and the mainstream rap music. Those keywords are then analyized in the keyword in context analysis.

The `6_Question_2_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` notebook compares the sentiment polarity score between Quadeca's later music and the mainstreap rap music during 2018, 2019, and 2020.

The `functions.ipynb` stores all the functions that are used throughout all the data analysis.
