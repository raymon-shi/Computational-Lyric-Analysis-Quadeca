I guess I missed your plan\nMe, I'm just searchin' for that truest shit, where is it, man?\nI'll never know, just wanted you to help me understand\nI need some closure because, truthfully, I give a damn, I give a damn\nPlenty of fish in the sea, but see, I ain't no fisherman\nSee, I'm a middleman, a businessman, and this means business, man\nDiggin' in the sand, lookin for a reason, I'm not kiddin', man\n\nHow am I gonna let all of this get to me? Been a few months since you texted me\nShit, I'll just tell myself I'm a celebrity, ain't no way that you can mess with me ()\nAnd in the big picture, this shit doesn't matter, but right now, it's feeling like everything\nThe more I talk about it, it just gets sadder, I 'member thinkin' 'bout a wedding ring\nBut now I'm thinkin' 'bout so many things, what did I do to deserve it?\nThis shit the most petty of petty things, I'll stick with how nobody's perfect\nLike all of my life, I'll forget about it and all of the things that I'd said about it\nBut why the fuck did I get blocked? I just cannot wrap my head around it\nYeah\n\nI think she blocked me on the Instagram\nI need to know, what did I do? I guess I missed your plan\nMe, I'm just searchin' for that truest shit, where is it, man?\nI'll never know, just wanted you to help me understand\nI need some closure because, truthfully, I give a damn, I give a damn\nPlenty of fish in the sea, but see, I ain't no fisherman\nSee, I'm a middleman, a businessman, and this means business, man\nDiggin' in the sand, lookin for a reason, I'm not kiddin', man\n\nHello, nobody is available to take your call\nPlease leave a message after the tone\n*beep* Uh\nI guess, there were just a couple things I wanted to say\n\n\nSpectacular speculations, I'm havin' some reservations\nImaginin' all the statements that's travellin' through these places\nBack in, then buy some passionate trashin' of reputations\nThat actually don't have facts, and reality left them baseless\nI wish that we left them nameless, associate 'em with faces\nMake judgments from expectations and watch as their heads are shaking\nThese people want me to crumble and turn to some medication\nTo fuck up my motivation and focus on education\n\nBut I'm petty, petty, petty, petty, that's all they really ever tell me\nSo many times that you convince me of shit, that I swear you could've won a Emmy\nI got a phone in my hand, like a note for the 'Gram, I'm thinkin' about holdin' your hand, but you don't understand\nI think that love is either gold or a scam, and you never really know till the end, like, how all this began\n\nI've been comin' at this as a man, trying to figure out where I fit into the plan\nHow does all the drama surround me? I hear 'em followin' loudly, and I don't wanna hear about this shit again\nI guess that's the way it goes when they stalk me and do anything to try and stop me\nI did nothing wrong, but that's how it goes when a basic bitch try to block me\n\nYeah"

Man, it's holdin' me sane\nCan't get you out of my brain, like a horrible stain\n\nI remember when I first met you\nYeah, I never thought that I would forget you\nNever thought that I would ever upset you\nAnd I never thought that I would ever regret you\nYeah, times change and my mind changed\nCan't get you out of my brain, like a migraine\nI really risked it all when the time came\nAll this shit just had to hit me like a migraine\n\nShould'a never let a girl ()\nRepresentin' everything I hate about the world (Yeah)\nCome up in my life and flip it straight into reverse (Yeah)\nYou was tryin' to make it hard, I was tryin' to make it work\n(Work) That's a first (Yeah)\nAnd a last\nHomie told me, \"Focus, leave the drama in the past\" (Drama in the past)\n(Past) Let it pass\nHurting people hurt people, true (True)\nFunny how the lies lead to truth (Truth)\nWhen it's over, I ain't over you\nAnd I ain't sober, know you rollin' too (Yeah)\nLove don't just get up and go, feelings always here to taunt\nI've been tryin' to let it go\nWaitin' for a text that I don't even want\nI can't even front\nI would probably say, \"I'm down\" (Down, down, down)\nIf shorty hit me with the, \"We should chill\"\nIf shorty hit me with the, \"Are you down?\"\n\n(Think of it like the Holocaust) Nah\n(Never again, alright?) Nah\n(That is what got us here in the first place)\n\n\n(*inhaling*) Yeah\n\nThere's a reason these cliches exist\nI keep trying to forget, my mind replays this kiss\nUh, fuck! I don't mean to delay my bliss\nI've been all over the mix, and now, she takes a sip\nThen we take it in, see my seat change and shift\nIt's a weekday, and I got so much sleep, caving in\nAnd now, I really can't tell if this a dream-state I'm in\nIf it is, I'll wake up depressed that my dream days are myth (*inhaling*)\nI'm telling myself, \"Please don't let this be fake, I'll trip\"\nI told her, \"Pinch me if it's real\", and then she came to pinch\nAnd as she made her way close to me, aye, I flinched\nSwitch! It all just disappeared to the remains, I drifted a-\n\n-Way"

I'm jealous if people sellin' platinum\nWorst year of my life? That's like saying the worst Kendrick album;\nIt's way better than average, I'm already established\nUnforgettable, classic, y'all shit is set to go plastic\nThey wanna see me disappear like incredible magic (Pew)\nYour regrettable attitude is upsetting my passion\nYeah, I'm getting listens and plays, fuck all the simpler days\nI just took a two-month break and got Spotify paying me minimum wage\n\nI'm like, that's good enough, man, I been eating, ain't full enough, I just wanna make it pullin' up\nI been puttin' up with all these amateurs, sure enough, I'mma show 'em how it should be done\nYeah\n\nThey don't know, they don't know 'bout what I do (What I do)\nI ain't anti-social, I just don't like you (Don't like you)\nAsk me how it's goin', I'll say \"wonderful\" (It's wonderful)\nThey tell me \"settle down,\" they too comfortable (Comfortable)\nAnd, man, they really used to love me, now I'm feared (Now they fear me, pew)\nThat's what happens when they see the clout appear\nAsk me 'bout my job, I got multiple (Multiple, pew)\nGot blue hundreds damn them shits so colorful (Colorful, oh)"

I can't find it\nAll alone in this momentarily\nTerrified that I might just fall\nGot crucified, but see, it's all my fault\nMy patience lost and my soul weary\nI pray to God, but he don't hear me\nI plead for help, but no answers given\nI do relate to these hopeless children\nNo faith inside them, no (Oh, Lord)\nCan't tell them nothing, though (They gone)\nMy heart it bleeds for y'all, you know\nI feel ya' pain, I feel ya' hatred\nFeel the track that's filled with love that feels as a friend, it pays\nTake ya' time, but don't move too slow\nNo room for growth in this world, darling\nNo amount of money can replace respect\nAnd all the bullshit that we accept\nI'm very vexed and I'm blessed indeed\nSo I do proceed to give them what they need\nAnd tell them, \"Ba-ba-ba-back the fuck up off me\"\nThis life is mine, well, that's one that's costly\nMy piece of mind is what the game has cost me\nMy heart done turned cold, so cold (Cold)\nI'm young but feelin' old, so old (Old)\nI wonder how it ends, I don't know (Know)\nMy thoughts that fade into the unknown ('Known)\nIt's getting darker when life gets harder\nI won't get caught up with all the madness\nI will stay focused to avoid distractions\n\nLove"

Is he on lean?\"\nNah, I ain't about that\nThe music that I make is a motherfuckin' soundtrack\nTo the dopest life, Big Sean better bounce back\nEverybody tryna raise the stakes? Well, they better take it out back\nI got a lot on my mind\nAnd I'm not gonna stop for a red sign\nTalking a lot 'bout the headlines\nMy death and the time left on the clock's all I got as my deadline\nDon't open up shop by a set time\nI ain't DMX, I don't read your texts\nI may be the worst, I may be the best\nAll I know is I feel obsessed\nI feel depressed knowing that this shit is only temporary\nRelieve some stress, 'cause shit is only temporary\nFree will, but others control what we feel\nEvil, less clear than it looks in the cemetery\nIt's getting scary, I vocalize all that I hope inside\nSocial life over my goals in life\nPosts online more important than my golden time\nSo many goals in mind, I cannot go behind\n\nWho woulda thought that a motherfucker'd hop on a UK vibe like I'm Drake?\nWho woulda thought I'd be spitting all these syllables without making a single mistake?\nWho woulda thought, I would be on the top, zooming past like a car with no brakes?\nThirteen reasons I'm gonna make these rappers kill themselves before they put out a tape\nWho woulda, who woulda thought? Who woulda, who woulda, who would, who woulda?\nI'm gonna be bigger than eleven times Earth, too hot like I'm motherfucking Jupiter\nI'm a new hitter, I'm a new spitter, coming outside and they saying that I'm great\nThirteen reasons I'm gonna make these rappers kill themselves before they put out a tape\n\nWho woulda, who woulda thought\nThat Quadeca woulda moved to the top? I've been doing a lot\nSee me for the music I make\nNot the views, or the shoes that I bought\nI mean who woulda thought that I'd go up, up and away?\n5K to 100K in a month how I play\nMotherfucker think he running the game\nSee these haters, now they running away \u2019cause I've come here to stay\nComing from the jump in L.A\nBut a boy been coming up in the bay, where they utter my name\nI'm like, \"Man, what-what do I say\nTo a friend who think we one in the same?\" 'Cause I'm done with the games\nSaying, \"This is fucking insane\"\nWanted bars, well no one can complain, yeah, they loving the claims\nI got an abundance of pain\nWhen I drop it, it just bust into flames, it just bust into flames\nYeah\n\nWho woulda thought that a motherfucker'd hop on a UK vibe like I'm Drake?\nWho woulda thought I'd be spitting all these syllables without making a single mistake?\nWho woulda thought, I would be on the top, zooming past like a car with no brakes?\nThirteen reasons I'm gonna make these rappers kill themselves before they put out a tape\nWho woulda, who woulda thought? Who woulda, who woulda, who would, who woulda?\nI'm gonna be bigger than eleven times Earth, too hot like I'm motherfucking Jupiter\nI'm a new hitter, I'm a new spitter, coming outside and they saying that I'm great\nThirteen reasons I'm gonna make these rappers kill themselves before they put out a tape\n\nYeah!"
