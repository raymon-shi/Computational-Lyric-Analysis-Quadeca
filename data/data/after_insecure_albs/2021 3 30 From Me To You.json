Will they still feel somethin'?\nAin't nobody laughin', but it still feel funny to me\nIt's all a game, all these people just a number to me\nAnd what could it be?\nNo matter how I feel, you could bet I'll give 'em somethin' to see\nWhat's the price of livin' comfortably?\nAll these numbers mind-numbin' to me, it's nothin' to me\nGet my pants tailored with the big pockets\nI don't give 'em much room when they shit-talkin', ayy\n\nTurn the cameras on\nQuick water break in the marathon\nWalk in your room and I set the mood\nThey ain't gotta light the motherfuckin' candles on fire\nCan't see without the cameras on\nWithout a platform to be standin' on, uh\nAll this baggage goin' over they heads\nSo I keep it underneath how I carry on, ooh\n\nTurn the cameras on\nWalk in your room and I set the mood\nThey ain't gotta light the motherfuckin' candles on fire\n\u2014Cameras on\nWithout a platform to be standin' on\nAll this baggage goin' over they heads\nSo I keep it underneath how I carry on, ooh\nThe route up the ice ridge was hard, but safe\nBoyson could watch the avalanches go by and even enjoy the view"

Why my catharsis feelin' like errands to me?\nIt's a target, archers with no arrows to tee, it's apparent to me\nAnd I said\n\nI woke up this mornin', or should I say afternoon?\nEverything is borin', I'ma fuck up my attitude\nI woke up this evenin', I'ma have to get back to you\nTomorrow, yeah, mm\nI woke up this mornin', or should I say afternoon?\nEverything is borin', I'ma fuck up my attitude\nI woke up this evenin', I'ma have to get back to you\nTomorrow, yeah, mm\n\nTracks I'm sinking in\nWhat you think of him again?\nI can't leave your bed\nAin't no other way, maybe another day\n\nMaybe another day (I've been standin' at the face of it)\nI need you to stay (I've been tryna get away from it)\n\nYeah, tryna kill my coma\nFuck this self-reflection bullshit, I already filled my quota, at least twelve times over\nI've been trying too much lately\nI've been doin' some thinkin' about how much I've been thinkin', and I think I overthink a little too much maybe?\nMaybe not, I don't know, I got a fear of flyin', I been in the sky, on a oneway (Woah)\nEvery plane hit the ground someday, who knows if it ends on the runway? (Someday, runway)\nBut I still shake with the turbulence, stewardess come with an arrangement of services\nI don't know what I wanna drink, bitch, I'm tryna rethink what my fate and my purpose is over here, uh (Ow!)\nThought we was close, but it's nowhere near, uh, fuck it, so much for the golden years, uh\nI'm feelin' down on my downtime, I'm feelin' now it's about time\nThat I say, uh\nI'ma hit you back another day, yeah\n\nI woke up this mornin', or should I say afternoon?\nEverything is borin', I'ma fuck up my attitude\nI woke up this evenin', I'ma have to get back to you\nTomorrow, yeah, mm\nI woke up this mornin', or should I say afternoon?

That's a bit pathetic\nI cut off all of my friends more easily than YouTube vloggers doing quick cut edits\n\nOkay, I'm fuckin' stressed\nCome from the heart, that's why I be sayin' this shit with my fuckin' chest\nI'm burnin' all my fuckin' bridges 'til there's nothin' left (Ha)\nThe more they try to prove their worth, the more I'm unimpressed\nI trust no one but myself, he the only one that hasn't fuckin' left\n\nOkay, I'm fuckin' stressed (Yeah)\nAll these hatin' niggas 'round, might need a fuckin' vest (A fuckin' vest)\nI'm from where if you ain't movin' right, you might get fuckin' left (Fuckin' left)\nAnd they copy what I do, might need a fuckin' check, cash flow\nNiggas be sayin' the way that I move, I'm a asshole (A asshole)\nShe think she my girl, that make me laugh, ho (Hahaha)\nNiggas be comin' with choppers, like \"Boom, boom, boom\", bad bone (Bad to the bone)\nMade a couple million, yeah, that's facts, phone- click; hang up\nThey say I'm running out of hangers, say they want beef? I'ma bring the angus\nNiggas want clout, fuck being famous, they tryna flex? I'ma be the trainer\nCome where I'm from, make you give your chain up, you ain't tryna fuck? Tell her get her brain up\nThat ain't my girl, I ain't tryna claim her, if you in my way, better switch the lane up\n\nOkay, I'm fuckin' stressed\nCome from the heart, that's why I be sayin' this shit with my fuckin' chest\nI'm burnin' all my fuckin' bridges 'til there's nothin' left\nThe more they try to prove their worth, the more I'm unimpressed, uh-huh (Ooh!)\nI trust no one but myself, he the only one that hasn't fuckin' left\n\nI burn bridges, but I'm still payin' the toll for it (Woo-ooh!)\nI burn bridges, but I'm still payin' the toll (Woo-woo!)\n\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh\nClimbing is quite enjoyable\nIf it wasn't as tiring, I would push right up the mountain\nBut in fact, it is making a hundred foot a day or so, you know\nWhich makes up something pathetic\n\nOkay, I'm immune from the herd, like an anti-vaxxer (Ooh)\nUsin' my words like a tantrum-haver (Huh?), I got used to the hurt from the random chatter\nThey viewin' the verse and get antsy after, no squares in my corner, like a cam reactor\nTreat a hater like my wife; take 'em out to dinner, make a whole album about 'em like I'm Chance the Rapper, like, uh (Ayy!)\nWe need to make a comparison (Hmm), oh shit, that's embarrassin', oh\nThey said beware of the snakes in the grass, but I'd rather be wearing 'em, uh (Ayy)\nEveryone knows if I say it, it's facts, this shit ain't no narrative (What?)\nGo against me, and they play like they scared to win, eatin' the beat, I'm a fuckin' American, uh\n\nI'm like, \"Ayy!\"\nLet's be honest, I really had a long, long day!\nOkay, uh, I walked in like, \"Bitch, what more can I say?\"\nOkay, what? Huh? What more can I say?\nStill got the statements, stack 'em up, uh, you been in the way, bitch, back it up, uh\n\nPractice what you preach, I guess that's why they talkin' trash, uh-huh, uh (\"Uh-huh\")\nNow they wanna pose with me, like \"Uh-uh, not so fast\", uh-huh, uh (\"Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy-!\")\nYour label be over me like, \"Why we ain't thought of that? Huh...\"\nSeeing me overseas off the grid, but I'm on the map (Okay, uh)\nJust got the next statement, shit is out of line like David Luiz, uh (David Luiz)\nSo many Ben Franklins, only blue life that matters to me\nWholly new life, how it happened to me? No daps, now they actin' bougie\nWhat you cook is from the cap, like you Ratatouille, absolutely mad, if you didn't like that, then sue me\n\nI'm like, \"Ayy!\"\nLet's be honest, I really had a long, long day!\nOkay, uh, I walked in like, \"Bitch, what more can I say?\"\nOkay, what? What? What more can I say?\nStill got the statements, stack 'em up, uh, you been in the way, bitch, back it up, uh\n\n*Sounds of wind and someone walking through the snow*\nUh..."

That shit for the indecisive\nYeah, I might be trippin', but at least I fuckin' picked a side, and\nI've been doin' bigger shit, no way that they didn't like it\nIf that's true, I smash they fuckin' phone before they finish typin' (Fuck you!)\nLook into the finer things, ain't no quality time when\nI make a couple milli' and I gift a couple diamond rings, I've been hopin' that's what time will bring\n'Cause the clock tick the same no matter how many times they say I'm a king, and it kinda stings\nI just had like twenty-five Red Bulls, still tryna find them wings, like a blind Rick Ross\nMind exhaust, check the headlines, deadlines ain't soft\nI don't want a fuckin' moment to blink, a moment to think, 'cause even just a moment got me kinda lost\nSo I'm tryna hit my thoughts with this white noise, from this fax machine in my ear\nPrintin' everything I didn't wanna hear, I don't know where they from, but the message so clear\n\nWhen I say we gon' work... until the trap out\nI been grindin' all day, I'm 'bout to cash out (Woo)\nWe gon' put in work until it work out (What?)\nAll these hoes be in my face, she got her ass out (Woo)\nShe gon' put in work until she clock out (Yeah)\nI can't never love these hoes, I'm on my cash route (Uh-huh, ayy)\nWe gon' put in work until it worked out (Yeah)\nWe gon' put in work until I pass out\n\nThis the hardest puzzle, can't pop it, it's the sharpest bubble\nThought process repeat so much, I think my mind got carpal tunnel (Ow!)\nI out-pulled my strongest muscle? Mixed up, the cards are shuffled (Huh?)\nPicked up, then start to fumble, this what I want, it's humble:\nI just want it all to double\nEven the stress, even the mess, even the larger struggle\nI want a ghost, don't need Heaven, I fantasize over purgatory\nInvest, so now my money makes money, it's workin' for me\nThey just bring bounds of distractions, explainin' how to be happy\nLouder than words, I can't hear them over the sound of they actions\nCalculate hourly rates, guilt when I'm havin' to break (Haha)\nThis world gon' take what you have if they see that you have what it takes (Ooh!)\nAnd that puts you back in your place, no matter how highly regarded (Uh)\nYou're not content, you endin' up in the line where you started\nAnd all these sacrifices, can't take 'em back\nI fucked up way too many connections, I shouldn't be so okay with that\nBut I'm okay with dirt on my name if it helps to make it last\nI pray for that; I need my credit before the fade to black\nYeah\n\nSo we gon' work until it work out\nSo we gon' work until it- work until it-\nWork until it- work until it- work until it- work until it-\nWork until it- work until it- work until it- work until it-"
