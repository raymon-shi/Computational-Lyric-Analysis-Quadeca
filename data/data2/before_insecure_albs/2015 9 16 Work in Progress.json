No, never\nI think I'm so clever, but in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better\nBut I don't ever\nWant to go to show just one mo' letter\nI'm a go-getter, I go get grades and get A's\nAnd get laid, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid\nUh... my life is so unusual\nTo most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable\nCan't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral\nI'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero\nDamn... but you know that I'm capable\nYou know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available\nFeelin' so unique, and I think it's not explainable\nNo one hears my lyrics, and says, \"OMG, relatable!\"\nNo... that's not what I am here to give\nBeen waitin' years for this, you're about to experience\nSomethin' that I've spent time, money, and thought on\nLearned about all the times money had thought wrong\nKinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long\nI ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot\nI'm freakin' out on the inside, you see me on the outside\nAlways think I'm positive, and never see the downsides\nIt's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it\nGet your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it\n\nSometimes, I don't know what to sing\nSometimes, I don't know what to think\nSometimes, I don't know what'll make it okay, make it okay\nI'm snorin' all day for dreams\nSometimes, I don't know what to sing\nSometimes, I don't know what to think\nSometimes, I don't know what'll make it okay, make it okay\nI'm snorin' all day for dreams\n\nI feel like I'm way too different\nRidiculous, and most of humanity's made of idiots\nI barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?\nYou think hidin' behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?\nPlease... what I do is barely poetry\nThere's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me\nUh... but still consider me confident\nStill consider me ready and givin' out all my flawlessness\nBut honestly, all of this is hauntin' me, probably\nIt is just a sense of myself wobbling, toppling\nInto awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'\nIt's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evenin'\nIt's callin' my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake\nI close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away\nYeah, we're just tryna find that great escape\nTo get away from how we're livin' life day-to-day\nSome people find it in a drink or in a cup\nOr in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love\nBut all I know is that it's tough\nAnd all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much\n\nSometimes, I don't know what to sing\nSometimes, I don't know what to think\nSometimes, I don't know what'll make it okay, make it okay\nI'm snorin' all day for dreams\nSometimes, I don't know what to sing\nSometimes, I don't know what to think\nSometimes, I don't know what'll make it okay, make it okay\nI'm snorin' all day for dreams"

I don't know if you're real\nBut listen to how this bumps, you'd supposedly feel like a god\nBut you-you get what I'm sayin'?\"\nAnd God damn, I just can't really express when I'm playin'\n\nI said it's bumpin', it's bumpin', y'all just go for a ride\nWe feelin' good at the top, man, we more than high\nYeah, we be feelin' it, know that this the realest shit\nAll the pain, this is healin' it, love it, I'm never leavin' it\nIt's bumpin'\n\nReally, this is bumpin' to me\nYou ain't feelin' it, so then you just get up and you leave\nBut this is somethin' to me, so don't come runnin' to me\nI said we comin' in this shit like we be fuckin' the dream\nShit... no, never mind, probably not\nBut I constantly got energy that's lost in my thoughts\nAnd I'm not gonna stop, and yes, this may be costin' a lot\nBut lookin' at the end result, man, we've accomplished a lot\nAnd no, I'm not gonna regret a thing after this\nI'm still tryna master this, 'cause now I'm known as that weird-ass rappin' kid\nThe fact of it is that it is really just a giant hobby\nSomethin' for me to be original, not a lyin' copy\nTryna make some shit where you can really get your head nodding\nVerses so fire that, when I'm done, you're left sobbing\nBut that won't happen, like I said, we just a work-in-progress\nSome of my shit means shit, and other words are nonsense\nBut now we easin' up, we got a beat that's bumpin'\nSee me stuntin' while I'm flowin', we adjustin', see me bluffin'\nEveryday man, see me bluffin', that is what I do\nListen to some good shit, tryna make a substitute\nI got so much stuff to do, and I am just a youngin' too\nWho just hopped on the scene? Everybody wonders who\nBut all I know is that we find a safety in rhythm\nAnd that is the reason that I am makin' a shipment\nI said it's bumpin'... yeah\n\nLiving is a dream, when you make it seem\nEnchanted (Enchanted)\nLovers take for granted\nAll the world's aglow, they ought' to know"

Gotta move yourself\nPursue the wealth\nI'm gonna do this shit, and I'ma do it well\nI've been through a hell, and now I'm movin' on\nGot so many things to improve upon\nI'm just tryin' to do what I can\nI really don't care if I'm losin' a fan, I'm just usin' my plan\nI'm pursuin' the glam, I'm removin' the spam\nI really hope that you understand\nUh\n\nLookin' out the window, seein' a life gone past me\nI got everything to make me happy\nAnd I'm starin' at the mirror\nAnd I'll take it in right now, because the world is so much clearer to me\nAnd I can feel your energy\nFrom millions of miles away\nAnd I'm sittin' in my room\nAnd I'm just lookin' for somethin' to say\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nAnd I've been sittin' in my room, I've been sittin' in my room\nI'm just lookin' for somethin' to say"

'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing\nNothin', 'cause for a brain, that is amazing\nNot complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it\nLove sleepin' and just usin' the internet\nBut my time is limited, and I better figure this\nBefore I'm slippin' this opportunity out my fingertips\nAnd let me just tell you what I have came to do\nTryna show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to\nTryna show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo\nAnd say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through\nAnd I've got some prominent features, I'm a confident speaker\nWhen I'm off and up on the spot, and eager\nThey fearin' this every time that they hearin' it\nTo know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid\nSo when you're nearin' this, please let me know\nWhen I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go\nI just try to combine everythin' into this compilation\nTo unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation\nBut that is just a dream, and probably a combination\nOf a big ego and false encouragement on the way in\nBut when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game\nI'm just tryna blow up, Ben, have a big name\nBut when you think about it, it is all insane\nWhat can be created from chemicals in this brain\nBut when you look at me, you lackin' respect\nWhen I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest\nHas in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step\nUntil I'm on the same stage, and you'll have it again, yeah!\n\nAnd I don't give a shit, man\nLife's a game, life's insane\nWe just livin' for a big plan\nI remain a lifeless frame of tired pain, and it's bland\nAnd I don't wanna do it\nI just know that it has to be done, it has to be done\nAll of y'all are rappin' for fun\nYou be takin' the shots, but you lackin' the gun, yeah\nSaid, I don't give a shit, man\nLife's insane, life's a game\nWe just livin' for a big plan\nI remain a lifeless frame of tired pain, and it's bland\nAnd I don't wanna do it\nI just know that it has to be done, it has to be done\nAll of y'all are rappin' for fun\nYou be takin' the shots, but you lackin' the gun, man"

Spendin' time on the internet\nI'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead\nI stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous\nWho is this ten year old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doin' this?\nWhy the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do\nI don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, \"Bye\", to you\nHey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do\nYou have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue\nYou gotta try to do, somethin' to put you into a new positive mindset\nSet headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead\nAnd I guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed\nYou're impressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said\nBut I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song\nI do writing, you do long, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron\nYou try to hate, get in line, I just delivered some quick rhymes\nSome straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline\n\nUh, and they say that I'm in time\nBut I keep on workin' all my life, get that in line\nI'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out\nNobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline\nI'm on the incline, I'm on the incline\nStay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine\nI'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline\nNobody can really understand how my shit climb"

Do you even know you? (No)\nDamn, this shit is like a Jaden Smith tweet\nSometimes, you gotta think 'bout how crazy shit be\nAnd lately, it seems to make the extremes\nSo prominent and dominant in making big dreams\nI'm seein' aliens scream\nWhen I go to sleep, man, my brain needs fixing\nBut, I'm just tryna make it in life\n\"Fuck you\" to people who be sayin' it like\nI ain't makin' it right, take a vacation and hike\nI'm chilled out, bitches, gettin' famous, despite\nThe fact that I'm young and a little bit nerdy\nAnd I know a lot of people will consider me early\nI'm just a little kid workin' tryna configure my searches (Oh!)\nTryna deliver my purpose, and take a shit on my burdens (Damn, man!)\nI'm just me, no, I ain't a victim or hurtin'\nI just see all the people livin' and burnin'\nSo be free, time to be a little bit nervous\nIt don't matter if you're scared, 'cause this shit is disturbin'\nAnd I get it, and I don't wanna ever forget it\nGuessin' I'm headed towards the endin', and I know it is splendid\nSo I'll see ya' 'round, underachievers (Yeah)\nHop on my wagon, 'cause we draggin' late, we gotta be leavin', man\n\nSo, basically\nI do this for fun, they ain't makin' me\nI'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growin' so fast\nWe be gettin' my career from A to Z\nAnd, basically, I'm great you see\nI made my life at the age of three\nBut what am I meant to do\nWhen my own fanbase are hatin' me?\n\nI've seen people misusing their fans like crooks\nManipulatin' their audience to catch that hook\nThey'll believe anything that you tell them, look-\nYou can feed them shit so you can sell your book, hah (Ooh)\nBut no shots fired, though\nNothin' wrong with a little bit of lyin', though\nI mean, look at Fox News\nThat's the whole premise of their entire show (Haha)\nBut no political shit\nI always do just enough, I'm a minimalist\nMakin' the most of my minimums, winnin' 'em\nGot a couple of synonyms to help you listen to original bits\nI have got a lot of digital prints\nMan, your own homedog is a literal bitch\nBut I'm fillin' the syllables, it's a little predictable\n'Cause I've written this shit for all of the cynical kids\nI got time! Maybe a little too much of it\nBut you know that I'm tryna move up a bit\nPeople look at me and say\nMy \"potential has got a big max\", and you know that I'm lovin' it\nSo fire, you can't handle me with oven mitts\nUnderground blessed if you have discovered it\nFlow's so unique, I do what I want\nGot so much to do, not like any other kid\n\nSo, basically\nI do this for fun, they ain't makin' me\nI'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growin' so fast\nWe be gettin' my career from A to Z\nUm, basically, I'm great you see\nI made my life at the age of three\nBut what am I meant to do\nWhen my own fanbase are hatin' me?"

You're mean\nThis is the craziest shit that you ever will see on your screen\nAnd I keep on settin' more goals to keep on headin' towards\nI try to rap with some fast verses and big words with some metaphors\nThis is the work in progress, a lot of shit to get better for\nBut I'm takin' steps, I keep makin' chances, not lookin' back anymore\nUh\n\nAnd I know\nEverything that you believe in\nAnd I know\nOf these things that you are seein'\nBut you'll never ever realize\nThat I am gonna be signed\nAnd everyone is waiting for the\nGlory, glory, glory (Oh)\n\nUh, yo\nMotivation is a rare occasion, I'm patiently waitin' for\nTime that we spendin' is wasted and traded for makin' more\nI hate the door, I hate it, remindin' me of the exit sign\nIt's safer just to quit, not to be risky, and never try\nYou have your path, I'd like to think I'm settin' mine\nBut I rarely stretch the line, I never really ever get to spend the time\nA lesson's learned, a less-than rhyme, but I can't express the mind\nOn hatin' uneducated basic comments are said online, uh\nBut, fuck 'em, does that even matter? It don't even matter\nI don't see them face-to-face and I don't meet 'em after\nAll I do is see disaster, all I do is see an empty face and I can't breathe with laughter\nAll I wanna do is leave the chatter\nAll you do is say, \"It's shitty\", 'kay, you just need to batter\nYou don't let it sit, you don't let it bake, you don't read the pattern\nAll I wanna do is spit some game, I can't be a rapper\nI will see down below, tell me if you need the ladder\nYeah\n\nAnd I know\nEverything that you believe in\nAnd I know\nOf these things that you are seein'\nBut you'll never ever realize\nThat I am gonna be signed\nAnd everyone is waiting for the\nGlory, glory, glory (Oh)"

It's a pure dream, somethin\u2019 that I can hardly imagine\nI\u2019m part of the magic, the art of the passion is somethin' so rare, man, it\u2019s hard to go grasp it\nBut you know I've accomplished it, look at the numbers and stare in astonishment\n\nRecently, I'm livin' with the same familiar feelin\u2019\nI've been livin' in a movie and I'm thinkin' that I'm dreamin'\nNow I feel like I am screamin' when I'm seein' all these seasons\nBut believe in what I'm breathing, there's no doubt, I will achieve it\n\nHell no! Hell no!\nI said, \"No\", to the people 'round me ('Round me)\nHell no! Hell no!\nNone of y'all know nothin' 'bout me ('Bout me)\nOh no! Oh no!\nI'm feelin' the rhythm in the down beat (Down beat)\nSo low, I'm so low\nOpportunity is up and around me\n\nI feel blessed, but I'm a demon, I guess that is the reason\nThat success is why I'm leavin', normal life that ain't appealin'\nBut you know I'm never stealin', I am playin' by the rules\n'Cause I made them up and usin' them to make it past my school\nI'm complacent when I'm facin', I embrace against the clock\nMy motto is, I'll keep on grindin' till I make it, never stop\nAnd I'm takin' on a lot, and I feel like I can do it (Oh no, no, no, oh no, no, no)\n'Cause I made this beat myself, I just keep on makin' improvements (Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no)\nIt's so weird to think, once things were all clear to me\nI'd never try to question them from what they would appear to be\nBut that's a losers game, the game of life is such a confusin' thing\nMost of its clues can never soothe the pain, but just look at each other, and do the same\nBut I'ma take a different path, if it means I go broke, I will live with that\nTo reach the top, man, I'm in for that, when I take this shit, I won't give it back\nI got an odd mentality, sometimes, I think that life is really not reality\nSuccess' definition hasn't got morality, or just, money, money, money, money on the salary\nSometimes I feel like I have lost my sanity, searchin' through my mind all across humanity\nBut I got my family and I got my health, got everythin' I'd ever need, but have I got myself?\nI've got to ask myself, \"Why am I after this?\", happiness outweighs the risk of the tragicness\nSo I know it's a gamble, I'm makin' a wish, and I'm blowin' the candles\n\nHell no! Hell no!\nI said, \"No\", to the people 'round me ('Round me)\nHell no! Hell no!\nNone of y'all know nothin' 'bout me ('Bout me)\nOh no! Oh no!\nI'm feelin' the rhythm in the down beat (Down beat)\nSo low, I'm so low\nOpportunity is up and around me"

I mean, it's all seemin' to be, and it's in inconceivable dreaming\nI know it's so unbelievable, being stuck in this rare unachievable feeling\nGivin' me somethin', I ended up leavin', givin' me nothin', I ended up grievin'\nNo positive side, ended up seein' what life could be like from a different lead in\nThank God for a cover zone so I know when and where to cross it\nLife goes all over the place, I'm surprised I haven't lost it\n\nAnd I'm feelin' like I'm at the top\nLivin' to the max now\nYeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud\nI'm steppin' up, I never back down, more focused on my background\nAnd the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down\nGo till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out\nAfter, I'll do the math now, it's garbage, take the trash out\nBut I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout\n\nOkay, it's time to go fast, so sit back and relax, and just maybe you'll get it\nAbout time, but maybe you're mad I said it, you gon' pay attention, cash or credit?\nI have to let it go back a second, I have some lyrics in the past that I have to edit\nGo back in the middle of the track , mix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it\nWe moved on, walked past the exit, want you to come back and pass a message\nI know you never pack bags and trash, you left it, kinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it\nMoney- never am glad I spent it, if I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it\nIf you ever feel bad or sad, accept it, think back to the track and  the rap that Ben did\nYeah, pretty obvious I'm killin' it, if this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus\nI'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this, voice is more powerful than a million instruments\nSuddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else, you all want me to go back because of you\nBut I'm never gonna level my endeavors to be better than the people that never had trust in me\n\nAnd I'm feelin' like I'm at the top\nLivin' to the max now\nYeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud\nI'm steppin' up, I never back down, more focused on my background\nAnd the music and how my rap sounds\n\nSpeak up, and they're messin' with the track now\nPeople tell me that I'm fallin' short, but I'm lookin' back at you when you're missin' all the cash now\nAnd I'm mad at the fact that I'm not in my right mind\nMeant to be a half-decent rapper, but I keep on sayin' all the wrong words at the right time\nLookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find, lookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime\nI find so much life, I wonder why I can't just find mine\nGot so many confusin' questions, so much knowledge, I can use some lessons\nI'm emergin' out with a new profession, I'ma do the best with my new perfection\nAnd I'm doin' it, I'm movin' onto this future shit\nThese hooligans are complete fools in that they just don't understand that I am through with it\nImprovin' it, I'm improvin' it, I got my brain, and I'm usin' it\nI'ma make it out alive when I'm playin' and takin' and makin' this cash, that I'm tearin' these tools to bits\nYou're clueless, ninety percent of y'all ignorant\nKeepin' your minds oh-so limited, get off your high horse, 'cause now it is time to figure it out\nSeemin' so close, I can picture it now, success in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now\nEnvisionin' deeper ambitions, and now, I'ma get to it, that is what livin's about"
