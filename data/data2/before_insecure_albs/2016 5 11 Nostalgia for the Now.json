Damn, my life sucks\" (Yeah)\nGotta go when the time's tough\nYou never know when your time's up\nYou never know when the people that you once trusted turn they backs on you\nAnd you lookin' like, \"What?\" Yeah\n\nGot these one-verse songs and it's all done\nDamn, these ain't the worst songs, but they all run\nWhen fall's done, we be headin' for winter\nThey all wanna doubt me, say, \"Ben's a beginner\"\nBut I've been workin' hard, I've been practicin'\nGot no time, but I still put the passion in\nMake it happen, man, man, it's happenin'\nDamn, this magic shit, who'd imagine this?"

That's nice to be given advice when I paint it\nHave twice much the fame, and\nI can't even comprehend that much in the future\nHatin' the teacher, but you loving the tutor\nEnter the game, I'm a fuckin' intruder\nStealin' these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter\nProcrastinatin' 'cause my fucking computer\nNo willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser\n\nSome people find it in the drink or in the cup\nOr in some bling or in the drug\nOr in the things that give us love\nWe're just tryna find the great escape\n(We're just tryna find the great escape)\nWe're just tryna find the great escape\n(Sometimes I don't know what'll make it okay, make it okay)\n(I'm snoring all day for dreams)"

Well, I guess that I'm pretty okay\nThings are picking back up in terms of building my name\nNot to jinx it, but I'm pickin' certain windows to fame\nGot a lot of support from random strangers that I have never met\nBetter yet, the minute you change it, bet they all get upset\nLike you only exist as this one element\nTake a breath of fresh O2 when they can't get with it\nKind of a humblebrag, I'll admit it, I did it, spitted\nI'll fix it, miss it, hit it, submit it, until it fit in\nI'll do it, keep on improvin', with music that I will fuse with\nI'm usin' a couple moves, and so, people know I'm pursuin', and\nWhen you dream about the hall-of-fame\nYou think about how people used to call you names\nAnd you check and wonder if it would be all the same\nStep back into reality, it all remains\n\nThe least listened song on the album\nThe least listened song on the album\nHow come, when you try to talk some sense\nYeah, they never want to spend any time you're around 'em\nAnd even if they- hear it, man\nI doubt that they'd be listening, yeah\nAnd even if they hear it, man\nI doubt that they'd be listening"
