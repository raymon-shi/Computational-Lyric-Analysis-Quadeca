I guess that's what happens when you grow up\nDry your eyes and wipe your nose up\nJust keep drinking till you throw up, no, we won't judge\nBut we all just want to be loved and somehow get validated by those we hate\nSuch a twisted system that we've been given to operate\nI've been really thinking and figuring out who's not a fake\nWash away the thoughts I made along the way, it all has changed\nAnd now, I'm looking, it's so far away\nAnd it's so far away\n\nDo you want to rule the world?\nOr do you just want to sit there? If you want to rule the world\nYou should probably start right now\n Hi!\n\nAnd I do not want to go away (Ooh-ooh)\nGo away from you (Ooh)\nBut I know that there's no escape (Oh-oh)\nNo escape, from the truth (Oh)\nI guess I must show the way (Hah-ah)\nGo today will do (Oh)\nJust one thing that's so mundane (Ooh-oh)\nBut so amazing too (Oh)\n\nYeah, just let the wind blow (Ooh-ooh)\nYeah, just let the wind blow (Ooh)\nYeah, open the window (Ah-ah)\nYeah, just let the wind blow (Ah)\nUh, let the wind blow (Ooh-ooh)\nJust let the wind blow (Ooh)\nOpen the window (Hah-ah)\nYeah (Ah, oh)"

Don't come close to mine\nI'm mostly fine, so please leave me alone to whine\nAnd, next time you talkin' shit, please bring me an open mind\n'Cause people lockin' they own ideas in straitjackets\nI'm David Blaine's magic, I'm helpin' you break past it\nI'm tryin' to raise havoc, not tryin' to stay savage\nTryin' to make balance while findin' my great passion\nI'm climbin' to get up this while witnessin' injustice\nBy who people in love with or based off of skin colors\nThis shit is so disgustin', I'm seein' it in public\nI'm tryin' to make sense of it here in the discussions\nAnd I close my eyes and go to sleep, waitin' until they notice me\nWaitin' till my creations are makin' everything so complete\nMy thoughts are scattered, I find lots of patterns\nI try not to let it get my plots in ashes\nThe system is givin' them two paths like, \"Choose that\"\nI'm turnin' my bruised back, say \"Fuck it\" to boot straps\nI'm wearin' my own shoes through that huge path ahead of me\nOne that I'm tryin' to pave with the new rap celebrity\nSometimes, the superficial is somethin' that's so enticing\nSomething that's so inviting, I gotta show when it's biting, yeah\n\nTropical bars, man, yeah\nThat's all I really needed to say, yeah"

I got the fame\nPutting commas to my name\nShit will never be the same\n\nYeah\nOh\nShit will never be the same"

    "lyrics": "The way I'm blowing up is very lowkey\nI'm the real shit, but y'all karaoke\nI don't give a fuck about a thirty-karat Rollie\n'Cause when I spit this shit, y'all looking like the scared emoji\nI can't look up to these rappers if they're below me\nGot an army so big, it's compared to Kony's\nPlay this shit in the woods, see a bear named Smokey\nTelling you to be a little more careful, homie\nI'm very lonely, spotlight glaring on me\nAnd I'ma make it to the top like my parents told me\nIf you really think you're there, then show me\nI'ma kill so many rappers they gon' have to hold a ceremony\nFor some reason, every white rapper is Eminem\nThis message coming from the Cloud, but it ain't heaven sent\nI ain't Future or Futuristic, I'm present-tense\nThen again, I've been sweating gems since like 2010\nWhen Ben was ten, they said, \"He'd never be ahead of them\"\nLike how they said that Trump could never be the president\nShit, I don't understand that, bro\nPut my finger in the game, like I'm Amber Rose\nDamn, that's low, shit too heavy to handle, bro\nI'm so ill, that Travis can't find the antidote\nI guess what I learned is that our future can't be known\nLook at the guy that this nation told to command the globe\nYou said Obama's from Kenya and he's replacing him\nAnd the racism in our nation's not safe to live in\nIt's like my fourth grade math class, in the same division\nBut, man, the nation wants some change, and this the way they'll get it\nPoor mother with a child trying to make a living\nScrutinized because you chose a different faith than Christian\nBut all of these rides, man, they ain't goin' to make a difference\nBecause the people with the power'd rather play than listen\nFuck politics, I'll admit, I got a lot of shit\nOn my conscious, and I've been haunted with on my confidence\nMy following got a lot of opposites, it's ominous\nThat people gonna suffer the consequence 'fore I'm copping it\nIt's obvious, Wall Street lobbyists run out the lobby quick\nHalf the nation feel like they Bobby, bitch\nWhite supremacy in America's anonymous\nWe need some thicker skin, but where the fuck's the dermatologist? Yeah\nI'm too preachy, it's too easy\nTo trash all of the shit that they be saying on the news, TV\nBut how the fuck that did that even happen, like Houdini\nConfederate flags with more than a few retweets\nI don't want to be the ultra-typical liberal\nThat's repeating BuzzFeed bullshit like a ritual\nI don't wanna pander fake shit to seem political\nI just wanna be critical as an individual\nFuck it! I sound like Filthy Frank\nA bad internet rapper, but I'm still the same\nI fill the banks, stuff bags, like a pillow case\nI build my rank, doing it until I'm great\nAnd I know the way, I do it, I got hell to pay\nI'm titanic, ice caps better melt away\nNo cool in the game, I can't celebrate\nUntil I'm really at the top, I gotta elevate, yeah"

That's some decision\nComing in this, I wondered, \"Is this a road that they'll be fucking with?\"\nThey loving it, making paper, like Dunder Mifflin\nStill got haters and doubters I keep on running into\nYou got a problem? Hop on the track, I'd love to diss you\nPeople hate on successes, you got some fucking issues\nLike, God damn, need me to get you another tissue?\nPlease leave and don't come back, no one'll miss you\nI won't, I'll shrug my shoulders and just continue\nOn my mission, encountered a lot of villains\nI'm kicking them down repeatedly lyrically, like it's some Jujitsu\nI'm doing oh so well\nY'all emo, Tokio Hotel\nMan, I flow so well, and I don't just yell\nMan, I'm like the word 'gold', but I hold no Ls\nMan, you see me, up on your TV (Woo!)\nY'all scratching the surface, but I am in 3D (Ayy)\nYou do not believe me\nI'm Mario, and y'all are worse than Luigi\nMy pics getting retweets\nI am exotic, like water from Fiji\nI freestyle my flow\nAnd it's better than your writtens, you can't defeat me\nAyy!\n\nI'm a man that is on a mission\nThirty thousand, let that wallet glisten\nHundred thousand, now they gotta listen\nNow they trying to come up on the vision\nSo they seeing me in 2020\nYeah, they be seeing me, 20/20\nI got so many with me\nI'ma end ahead, man, I'm already ready, yeah\n2020\nWoo! 2020\nFour years time, I'ma have so many pennies\nThat the envy's heavy, yeah\n2020\nThat's 2020\nI got so many with me\nI'ma end ahead, man, I'm already ready, yeah!"

I am off the script\nWoo! I am off the script\nNo limits to my voice\nThis shit is my choice, damn, I gotta win\n\nNo, I ain\u2019t a bird in the trap\nWorking like that, but I have been searching the map\nTrying to find another fucking person that raps\nPerfectly fast with beats that\u2019s certain they slap\nIf you know about the way I work on the track\nThen you know that I will always finish first, that\u2019s a fact\nEverybody laughed when they heard that I rapped\nUntil they heard me rap and confirmed that I\u2019m stacked\nFuck the Bay, I\u2019ll put Earth on the map\nGot the highest numbers, like the nerd in your class\nI\u2019m the only one that\u2019s coming in, curving the stats (Perfect!)\nThe words that I craft into verses, I'm mad\nI\u2019ve made mistakes, but at least I learned from my past\nPlay the song, your headphones turn into ash\nThat\u2019s what happens when I burn every track\nAin't like rappers who submerged under mass\nOr who look for validation from the shirts on their backs\nFriend accuse me of spending stacks on clothes\nBut the shit that they was wearing was worth more, in fact\nAin\u2019t that a blessing? I earned all this crap\nSo now, I like to flex in reverse, like an ass\nRunning circles and laps 'round these rap clowns, think they in the circus or act\nIt\u2019s absurd, and it\u2019s trash\nBut I\u2019m sure that it hurts to be servin' this crap\n'Cause I\u2019m coming up to get it, I ain\u2019t turning it back\nUh\n\nYeah, it\u2019s really me (Woo!)\nPlaying in the league\nI haven\u2019t seen you ballin\u2019\nI just see you falling, how it really be\nI am off the script (Yeah!)\nYou can\u2019t hold me back (Yeah!)\nI\u2019m independent, do the mixing\nAnd the selling, I control my path (Woo!)\nGetting it online\nDon\u2019t care if the money ain\u2019t on time\nThese artists ain\u2019t really artists\nIf they care about their bling more than the hot line\nI am off the script\nWoo!

This is dope, bro!\"\nI'm like, \"Hell yeah\", but I'm thinking 'bout what happens when I go home\nTo my family and know that they don't know\nShit, that's a no-go, guess I'm going solo\nBut now I'm getting paranoid\nLook at what I've fucking done to go repair a void\nThinking, \"What if my parents really got to know?\"\nGo silent, hear a knock at the door, shit!\n\n*sounds of someone knocking on a door*\n\n2016 was a bad year, yeah\n2016 was a bad year\nAnd even though we've grown from our past fear\n'16 was a pretty fuckin' bad year, yeah\n\nIf ignorance is bliss, I guess I pretend to be ignorant\nI guess I'm an idiot\nWe live in a world where people pretend they ain't different\nShit is getting ridiculous\nI won't spite you for tryna rock to somebody else's drum line\nFor a spot in the lunch line\nBut we gotta draw some line\nSo many lines to cross, I see god in my tees sometimes\nAnd I ain't even religious\nThe power of these words is as real as existence\nMan, I feel it from a distance\nFake friends leaving in an instant\nI guess it's plagued me for a minute\nI guess it's changed me for a year\nI guess it's made me who I am\nAnd I ain't gonna quit, frankly, I'll stay right here\nUnderrated, I haven't been respected\nPut in all this work and still be in the trenches\nFunny how rappers claim to be independent\nWhen their album got a hundred names in the credits\nDoing it by myself, no co-signer\nBetter bars than these rappers with they ghostwriters\nWho's gonna be famous? Well I'm the most likely\nBut the city people don't like me, so they go bite me\n\n2016 was a bad year, yeah\n2016 was a bad year\nAnd even though we've grown from our past fear\n'16 was a pretty fuckin' bad year, yeah\n\n\nI'll pray, I'll pray, I'll pray, I'll pray\nAnd I don\u2019t want to say\nThat everything will be okay\nNo way"
