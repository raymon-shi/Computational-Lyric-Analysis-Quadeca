Yeah, I\u2019m on my ego death\nI had to reassess, I had to resurrect, yeah\nHuh, hey, huh, I just wanna be the best\nBut I had to reassess, is that why I\u2019m feelin' less?\n\nYeah, huh, my songs are bipolar like Ye, huh (Huh), they think they controlling my fate, uh (Ooh, yeah)\nCut all the chatter, no, y'all are not rappers, you just some ad-libbers like, \"Ayy,\" huh (For real)\nI just pulled up, back in black, drop a hit, they react to that (Ooh, huh)\nNow they see this and they acting mad (Yeah), like I\u2019m Kanye in a MAGA hat, yeah\nI\u2019m so alone, see, I\u2019ve always been one and only\nEven back when this gold chain was made out of macaroni\nNow they always askin' me, what happened to the old me?\nI wish I could\u2019ve told him goodbye, wish he had known me (Yeah)\nWish that I could tell you 'bout how everyone would know you (Uh-huh)\nAnd tell you it\u2019s worth it, despite everything they told you\nCryin' silent in your pillow sayin', \u201cI wish I was homeschooled\u201d (Yeah)\nToo afraid to sing your songs because you thought that they would roast you, yeah\nI was nine, friends told me I would go lose (They did)\nNow it\u2019s time I think I gotta show you (Think I gotta show you)\nThat\u2019s my mind, say I don\u2019t care, but I so do\nHaving trouble walkin' up a mile in my own shoes\nNever used to bet on me and now they like, \u201cI owe you\u201d\nLookin' back at them like, \u201cThe fuck? I do not know you\u201d\nWhen I make a milli', mo\u2019fucker, I'ma show you\nWhat I had to go through to feel like I\u2019m supposed to\n\nEgo, I don\u2019t need no\nOther people in my trio\nMyself, I and me, though, we know\nWe don't need no kilos, my watch frio\nYeah\n\nI\u2019m on my ego death\nBut I let it breathe again, yeah, I let it resurrect\nYeah, uh (Yeah), I just wanna be the best\nBut I had to reassess, is that why I\u2019m feelin' less? Yeah (Yeah)\n\nOn the way, all okay, only a call away, feeling like a god on my Charlemagne (Huh?)\nI really think they want my presence, like a holiday (Yeah), but I think I need to learn when to walk away (I do)\nMan, I got so many problems, but I wanna stay without acknowledgin' how often I have gone astray (Yeah)\nFirst step is denial, but I\u2019m over that, and I\u2019ve accepted it already\nBut it holds me back, yeah, back, yeah\nSlurring my words, I been moving too fast, yeah (Okay), fast, yeah\nMaybe I don\u2019t wanna share it like that, yeah (Uh), that\u2019s facts, yeah\nI need to stop checking all of the stats, like that, like that, yeah, ayy (Yeah)\n\nI\u2019m on my ego death\nI had to reassess, I had to resurrect, yeah\nHuh, hey, huh, I just wanna be the best\nBut I had to reassess, is that why I\u2019m feelin' less? Yeah\n\nI got forty-thousand comments this week\nAt least five-thousand said that I should kill myself, I\u2019m a freak\nI\u2019m too weak, I'm a leech, and all my music fuckin' sucks, I\u2019m a geek\nI\u2019m everythin' they want me to be and that\u2019s the problem with me\nSo when they say you got a ego, tell 'em, \"Thank the fuckin' Lord\"\n'Cause if you didn\u2019t, you\u2019d be suffering, you\u2019d be stuck there on the floor with nothin' more\nAt least I\u2019m out here smilin' in the quicksand\nTake your head out of that pillow, one day, you gon' be the big man\nYeah\n\n\nIn the dark\nI stare into mirrors for hours\nUntil I can\u2019t recognize myself\nA dissonant reflection\nBoth a sober and a sobering hallucination"

Ain\u2019t got no closure for this open wound\nAin\u2019t got no closure\nBut the man on my shoulder, yeah"

(Who knows?) I look up to names for help (Yeah)\nBut how can our idols save us (No) if they can\u2019t even save themselves? (Facts)\nI gotta behave myself (Yeah), gotta remember my start, no, I will not betray myself\nI been afraid to tell, so alone, so, I just braced myself\nI\u2019ve wanted love since the age of twelve, even before I could lace myself\nThat\u2019s why, when I know I lose all that I love, that it\u2019s easy to hate myself\nIt\u2019s my birthday! But I won\u2019t celebrate myself (Huh?), 'cause time is gonna take myself (Yeah)\nI\u2019m on my Pro Clubs shit; I create myself, but I\u2019m never gonna rate myself\nPicture-perfect, is it workin'? Vision blurrin', missin' verses, life really is a burden\nSeein' my face on every sign; I\u2019m a missin' person, whatever he gets, the kid deserves it\nYeah\n\nI woke up, and my eyes were sore\nI gave you every last tear that I had, I don't think I can cry no more (No)\nAll of this red on my eyes looking like I never gotten high before (For real)\nThis is not regular love, this shit is a mile more (For real)\nI think this is God's way of reminding me I need to smile more (Yeah)\n\nLosing time, let me let you know before I lose my mind, yeah\nThese days, something must be on my side\nIf I lose, at least I\u2019ll tell 'em that I tried, yeah\nThat I tried\n\n]\nHahaha, it's so bad, I can't\n\nYou\u2019re nothing but a grain of sand in my hourglass\nBut I can spot you from a mile away, yeah\nI\u2019m searchin' for you"

(Doo, doo, doo, doo)\nOh, oh!\nBliss on the beat, baby\n\nThese days, nothin' matters when I look into your face\nNothin' in my past is a mistake\nIf it led me to this motherfuckin' place\nYeah, these- these days\nThese days I been feelin' free\nDrowned all of my demons in my sea\nRowboat never hits the shore\nBut I don\u2019t think I want to anymore (Yeah)\n\nI\u2019m feeling freer now, they said it gets better, I see it now\nShe took my demons out, they talk about love, I believe it now\nI was feelin' lost so long, with so many days gone, too many to even count\nThey never told me how easy it was to feel beaten when off of the beaten route\nI thought that life was alone with ice to my bones, and nothin' I could try\nI started rockin' designer, but found out that it was not something I could buy\nToo many hours I spent dwellin' on the good times\nWhile the clocks\u2019 hands waving back at me like goodbye\nTreat this like a eulogy, I ain\u2019t makin' rap songs\nYeah, I come fast, but this music gonna last long\nI been too concerned with what they writin' on my new post (For real)\nGotta start to think 'bout what they writin' on my tombstone (For real)\nI feel like the emperor, I went and copped some new clothes (Yeah)\nBut they seein' through me every second like a Hublot (Facts)\nPut that shit aside, I cannot live just for a replay (Nah)\nEver since you came into my life, you helped me see straight\n\nThese days, nothin' matters when I look into your face\nNothin' in my past is a mistake\nIf it led me to this motherfucking place\nYeah, these- these days\nThese days, I've been feelin' free\nDrowned all of the demons in my sea\nRowboat never hits the shore\nBut I don\u2019t think I want to anymore\n\n\nI used to make love songs when I was alone\nJust to pretend to feel how I do now\nThank God I'm with you now\nThank God I\u2019m with you now\nOh, oh\nI just wanna make you proud\nI just wanna make you proud\n\nThese days, I may regret what I say, but never how I feel\nI almost cried when I realized that everything was real\nWhen the brain can\u2019t articulate feelings in words, they just come out in tears\nNo matter what happens, I hope that you know I\u2019ll forever be here\n\nI was wrong about my song\n\u201cThe Man On My Left Shoulder\u201d, uh, 'cause he\u2019s been gone ever since you\u2019ve called\nSo I\u2019ll admit, it was not true, you\u2019re the reason I got through\nI knew it was love when I knew I\u2019d feel lost if I ever lost you\nThat\u2019s why when you believe in me, I can\u2019t describe what that means to me\nYou help me see what I can\u2019t see in me, easily\nI need to be between your arms, let\u2019s make this our secret song\nBut I can\u2019t keep a secret when I feel I need to scream it all (All!)\nCan\u2019t even fall, I can\u2019t leave it all in the dust\nBecause, no matter what, I fear that it\u2019s never gon' be enough\nTo repay for all of the trust, and the days I crawled in the rough\nGuess it made for a better story, was makin' all of it up, and then it came true\nYou help me hope, when I\u2019m faithless\nAdd a scope when I\u2019m aimless\nHelp me smile when I'm faceless, help me feel when I\u2019m numb\nHelp me hide when there\u2019s nowhere left to run, nowhere left to run\n\nThese days, I may regret what I say, but never how I feel\nI almost cried when I realized that everything was real\nWhen the brain can\u2019t articulate feelings in words, they just come out in tears\nNo matter what happens, I hope that you know I\u2019ll forever be here\n\nOh-oh\nI'll forever be here\nOh-oh-oh\nOh"
