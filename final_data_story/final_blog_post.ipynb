    "2018 was one of the most interesting years on YouTube. It was known as the year of the diss tracks, a trend popularized by a YouTuber named RiceGum. During this year, if you had conflict with another YouTuber, instead of rationally trying to settle the issue behind closed doors, people turned to writing and producing full-on diss tracks and music videos to attack other YouTubers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One particular incident that I would like to focus on would be the battles between KSI and Quadeca. While on a podcast, famous gaming YouTuber turned musician KSI decided to declare himself as the best rapper on the platform. When his friends suggested Quadeca as another noteworthy rapper within the community, KSI simply blew him off, said his music was trash, and said, “...stay in your lane until you get good enough.” A few days later, Quadeca posted a video reacting to the podcast and the criticism directed towards him from KSI. In his response, he strongly disagrees with everything that KSI said and was in disbelief that KSI thinks so highly of himself. Following the theme of 2018 YouTube, towards the end of the video Quadeca hinted at a diss track directed towards KSI.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What happened next, nobody saw coming….*\n",
    "\n",
    "On November 23, 2018, Quadeca dropped the music video to his diss track titled, Quadeca - Insecure (KSI Diss Track) Official Video. In his diss track, he mentioned topics like how KSI’s music was so bad it was used as a torture device, how KSI’s ego was insanely inflated and that he was surrounded by yes-men (his friends), how KSI doesn’t write his own music, how KSI may have had an abortion, and how KSI should retire from his music career and return to being a gamer. The music video itself was sensational and insanely garnered several millions of views when it was first released. During the time, a lot of people from the community reacted to the diss track and the general consensus was that Quadeca’s was legit and that he was winning the feud. KSI did respond to this diss track with a diss track of his own, however Quadeca did not send a second response. The feud would settle down and the parties would actually reconcile a year later.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the feud between Quadeca and KSI may have settled, the effects of Insecure were everlasting. To this day, the diss track has over 34.5 million views on YouTube and is Quadeca’s most viewed video of all time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insecure helped introduce Quadeca to a larger audience, most of whom have never heard of his name before. In fact, it was during this time that I discovered Quadeca myself. I was pleasantly surprised by his word-play, fast flows, and ability to create a catchy song. I was surprised that all of this was coming from a so-called “YouTube Rapper,” a label that was given to rappers who started and gained most of their following on YouTube. The label was used as a segregation between a “fake” rapper and a more legit mainstream rapper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever since Insecure, I’ve been following Quadeca’s musical journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "I saw potential and I wanted him to succeed. Not only is he talented, but he serves as proof that YouTube rappers/artists are just as legit as any other artist with a label and they should be taken seriously. \n"

    "* Did Quadeca’s musical themes and musical style change from the period before *Insecure* compared to the period after Insecure.\n",

This could mean that even though Quadeca may be talking about the say topics across both corpuses, he's finding new unique ways to talk about them as seen in the 46.06% unique 1-grams, 75.16% unique 2-grams, and 93.74% unique 3-grams.\n",

The line `you got a ego tell em thank the fuckin lord cause if you didn't you'd be suffering` seems to suggest that Quadeca's eagerness to prove his value as a rapper and knowing his worth saved him from being swallowed by his insecurities. Another interesting line is `reach this quota for success without sayin a fuckin word yeah if life's a test it doesn't`. This line could be referring to Quadeca reaching a level of success without dropping music for so long (his last project was in 2019, and his most recent project came out in 2021). Another interpretation of this line could be referring to society's expectation that success equates to happiness and that people who are successful shouldn't be complaining.  "

The other theme that Quadeca explores with the term `alone` is about a past relationship with an ex-girlfriend.

Quadeca reflects back on this relationship wondering if the two were just pretending to be in love and trying to make it work. One of the more interesting lines using the term `love` is `the drop though so i don't they only love me when i'm back on the climb yeah`. Here, Quadeca seems to be addressing people that are only interested in him when he's on the music grind and dropping music.  "

As a result, I thought that the sentiment scores between the two corpuses would be more or less the same. However, there is a significant difference between the sentiment score of the before corpus and the sentiment score of the after corpus.\n",

    ">From those themes that I discovered that Quadeca was rapping about, I expected more albums to have an overall negative sentiment and that both corpuses would have an overall negative sentiment value. However, it appears that both corpuses had positive overall sentiment values. This could mean that Quadeca is talking about some of these more serious and negative topics and the vader polarity score is misinterpreting/overcorrecting the sentiment of the song. An example of this can be seen in the the after album Voice Memos (2019) song titled \"The Man on My Left Shoulder (a_album_one_lyrics[4]).\" This song is talking about Quadeca and how he's dealing with an inner voice that always points out the negativity in life. This song is definitely a negative sentiment song, yet the vader compound polarity score returns 0.9967, which makes it seem like an extremely happy song when it's not. Another possibility for this result is that the keyness analysis and the keyword in context concordance analysis that I did overestimated the themes that were suppose to be in the albums.\n"

    "## Overall Observations Between Quadeca's Music and the Billboard Rap Music\n",
    "Here are some of the notable 1-grams between both Quadeca's corpus and the Billboard Rap Music corpus:\n",
    ">* Quadeca: `i, you, me, all, my, im, your, dont, know`\n",
    ">* Billboard Rap Music: `i, me, you, my, im, dont, like`\n",
    "\n",
    ">It seems that the most common 1-grams between the two corpuses are very similar. They seem to be focusing on a 'me versus you' type of theme. I found that the word `i` was used in nearly every song from Quadeca's corpus and was used in every song in the Billboard Rap Music corpus. I think this was expected because rappers tend to talk about themselves a lot in their songs and they tend to compare themselves to other rappers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the notable 2-grams between both Quadeca's corpus and the Billboard Rap Music corpus:\n",
    ">* Quadeca: `in the, in my, i got, on my, i just, yeah i, when i, that i, i think, i dont, im a, i cant, and i, i am`\n",
    ">* Billboard Rap Music: `in the, i got, i dont, on my, and i, got a, i aint, yeah i, in a, i was, when i, if i`\n",
    "\n",
    ">Again, I noticed the usage of the term `i` within the 2-grams. Once again, the 2-grams between these two corpuses are very similar. A lot of the 2-grams are referring to the rapper and what they're thinking of themselves and what materialistic wealth they have. This can be seen in the 2-grams: `i think, i am, im a, i got`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the notable 3-grams between both Quadeca's corpus and the Billboard Rap Music corpus:\n",
    ">* Quadeca: `i got a, i think i, i need to, i just wanna, i do not, i love you, im on my, i had to, just pulled up, i dont know`\n",
    ">* Billboard Rap Music: `yeah yeah yeah, i got a, i got the, i know that, i dont know, pull up in, i dont know`\n",
    "\n",
    ">Once again, the 3-grams between these two corpuses are similar and they both tend to talk about the rapper themselves. In both corpuses we see the rapper talking about having something over some else (`i got a, i got the`) or arriving in a what I assume would be a fancy car (`just pulled up, pull up in`). In Quadeca's corpus, we see that there are 3-grams that refer to feeling and love in the upper top 25, whereas in the Billboard Rap Music corpus, we don't see 3-grams that refer to feelings and love until the bottom 25 3-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other things that I've noticed where that even though the n-grams were fairly the same across the board, there are still differences in the n-grams that Quadeca uses and that the Billboard Rap Music uses. In fact, there are 832 unique 1-grams that are used by Quadeca that aren't used by Billboard Rap Music artist. When it comes to 2-grams, there are 5,815 unique bigrams that are used by Quadeca that aren't used by Billboard Rap Music artist. Finally, for the 3-grams, there are 10,882 unique trigrams that are used by Quadeca that aren't used by Billboard Rap Music artist."

    "After looking through the intersections of the most common and most popular n-grams, as well as the set difference between the two corpuses, I found that even though Quadeca's most common 1-/2-/3-grams are very similar to the Billboard Rap Music 1-/2-/3-grams, there are still quite a lot of unique tokens, bigrams, and trigrams that Quadeca uses that aren't found in the Billboard Rap Music corpus. In the case of 1-grams, Quadeca has 38.32% unique tokens. In the case of 2-grams, Quadeca has 68.10% unique bigrams. In the case of 3-grams, Quadeca has 91.38% unique trigrams. Although the 1-grams have a fairly low unique percentage, there are only so many words you can use that make sense in a rap. However, with the bigrams and trigrams having 68.10% uniqueness and 91.38% uniqueness respectively, I think it is safe to say that Quadeca's lyrics are fairly different from the lyrics of the Billboard Rap Music.

From these lines, it seems like Quadeca needs an escape, but there is nothing he can do. There are also references to a past relationship in the line `its you and me do you love me all you do you love me all you can`. In other uses of the word `all`, we see Quadeca noticing and address critics.

This is emphasized in the line `league so fuck an industry plant ill plant myself in the industry in my own shoes i`. Here Quadeca states that he doesn't need a label to break into the industry and that he'll do it by himself, with his own resources. \n",

This can be seen in the lines `ima hit you back another day yeah i woke up this mornin or should i say afternoon` and `is borin ima fuck up my attitude i woke up this evenin ima have to get back`. These lines can be interpreted either as Quadeca doesn't want to get up from bed as he has no motivation to go on with his day or that every part of the day (morning, afternoon, evening) are the same to him and as a result, he's burnt out from going through the motions. In other uses of the term `woke`, we see Quadeca reminiscing over a past relationship. This can be seen in the line `were just shades of us shades of us woke up on your side of the bed its`. Here Quadeca notes that towards the tail end of his relationship, they were just shades of their original love and now he's waking up on her side of the bed because she is no longer there to occupy it.

This can be seen in the lines `my life is a highlight reel swear my life is a movie red dot on my forehead`, `for a new car looking for a new life new life looking out a new lens uh`, and `in you mm uh everything changed in my life now i got some adjustin to do uh`. In these lines, we can see that Quadeca compares his new life to a movie and as a result, he has a target on his head. This growth in popularity could be a double edge sword because now this perpetuates the need for him to prove himself yet again to the critics and he has to adjust to his new life through a new point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In other uses of the word `life`, we can see more references to a past relationship. This can be seen in the lines `prove ayy ayy yeah oh we got different life plans i know oh tryna do what i`, `it work until it oh we got different life plans i know tryna do what i can`, and `falls through i want you back here of life will never be the same as last year`. We can see in these lines that Quadeca tried to make a relationship work, but in the end the two just had different life goals. It seems like Quadeca misses his ex-lover and wants her back, but the possibility of her coming back does not seem very likely.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Finally, some other uses of the term `life` are when Quadeca compares himself to other rappers. We can see this in the line `the wrong wrong life you in the wrong life bitch media painted the wrong light huh hard` and `life like a movie huh your life like a clip huh yeah hahahaha i do`. The first line can be interpreted as Quadeca saying that his life is superior and he's a better rapper and that other rappers who are worse than him made the wrong decision to be a rapper. The second line can be interpreted as Quadeca's career will be as long as a movie whereas other rappers' careers will be as long as a clip. In context, the length of a movie is significantly longer than the length of a clip, so Quadeca is saying that he'll have a long lasting career compared to some of these other rappers."

This can be seen in the lines `million sheep ill never be really complete even if i fill up an areana wit a million` and `these days something must be on my side if i lose at least ill tell them that i`. In the first line, we see that Quadeca says that he still wouldn't be happy even if he about to fill up arenas and perform for a million people. This just goes to show that fame and success is not the solution to everything. In the second line, it seems like Quadeca is noticing that he needs someone by his side. This could be in reference to a girlfriend or maybe just friends in general.\n",

We can see this in the lines `exist if you remember me ill only exist if you remember me you are not in love` and `drift away youre a memory ill only exist if you remember me you remember me ill only exist if you`. Here, we can see that Quadeca's relationship is nothing but a memory and it seems like the relationship ended so poorly, that the two people don't exist to each other unless they are forced to remember the relationship. Another interpretation of this could be that Quadeca was so reliant on the relationship that since the relationship is over, his own existence and self-worth is in jeopardy."

This can be seen in the line `em down walk em down walk em down  walk  em down walk em down walk em down` and `up yeah still doing drivebys but i wanna walk  em i wanna if i cant find em`."

    ">* the person listening to the track (ex: 3)\n",
    ">* other rappers (ex: 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "> From this random sample of the term `you`, it seems that mainstream rappers are talking about love and past relationships. This can be seen in the lines `my soul from me no way i gave you all my ecstasy i thought that you were` and `i guess you came through im running from  you  is your love for real for real for`. Other references to seem like mainstream rappers are referring to sexual acts. This can be seen in the line `was goin up and down like yoyo down you can say im greedy cause i always want` and `put you in the blender i could get you slushed haha i see the comments but really`. Here, rappers are comparing women performing sexual acts to yo-yos and rappers performing sexual acts to a blender and making things wet and slurry. Finally, it also seems like mainstream rappers are warning others not to mess with them or else they're going to retort. This can be seen in the line `not just a rapper you play with me you gon get stretched oohoh bring drake to the`. Here the rapper is saying that if you miss with him/her, then you'll hurt."
