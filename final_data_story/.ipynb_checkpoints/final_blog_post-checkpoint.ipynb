    "2018 was one of the most interesting years on YouTube. It was known as the year of the diss tracks, a trend popularized by a YouTuber named RiceGum. During this year, if you had conflict with another YouTuber, instead of rationally trying to settle the issue behind closed doors, people turned to writing and producing full-on diss tracks and music videos to attack other YouTubers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One particular incident that I would like to focus on would be the battles between KSI and Quadeca. While on a podcast, famous gaming YouTuber turned musician KSI decided to declare himself as the best rapper on the platform. When his friends suggested Quadeca as another noteworthy rapper within the community, KSI simply blew him off, said his music was trash, and said, “...stay in your lane until you get good enough.” A few days later, Quadeca posted a video reacting to the podcast and the criticism directed towards him from KSI. In his response, he strongly disagrees with everything that KSI said and was in disbelief that KSI thinks so highly of himself. Following the theme of 2018 YouTube, towards the end of the video Quadeca hinted at a diss track directed towards KSI.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What happened next, nobody saw coming….*\n",
    "\n",
    "On November 23, 2018, Quadeca dropped the music video to his diss track titled, Quadeca - Insecure (KSI Diss Track) Official Video. In his diss track, he mentioned topics like how KSI’s music was so bad it was used as a torture device, how KSI’s ego was insanely inflated and that he was surrounded by yes-men (his friends), how KSI doesn’t write his own music, how KSI may have had an abortion, and how KSI should retire from his music career and return to being a gamer. The music video itself was sensational and insanely garnered several millions of views when it was first released. During the time, a lot of people from the community reacted to the diss track and the general consensus was that Quadeca’s was legit and that he was winning the feud. KSI did respond to this diss track with a diss track of his own, however Quadeca did not send a second response. The feud would settle down and the parties would actually reconcile a year later.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the feud between Quadeca and KSI may have settled, the effects of Insecure were everlasting. To this day, the diss track has over 34.5 million views on YouTube and is Quadeca’s most viewed video of all time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insecure helped introduce Quadeca to a larger audience, most of whom have never heard of his name before. In fact, it was during this time that I discovered Quadeca myself. I was pleasantly surprised by his word-play, fast flows, and ability to create a catchy song. I was surprised that all of this was coming from a so-called “YouTube Rapper,” a label that was given to rappers who started and gained most of their following on YouTube. The label was used as a segregation between a “fake” rapper and a more legit mainstream rapper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever since Insecure, I’ve been following Quadeca’s musical journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "I saw potential and I wanted him to succeed. Not only is he talented, but he serves as proof that YouTube rappers/artists are just as legit as any other artist with a label and they should be taken seriously. \n"

    "* Did Quadeca’s musical themes and musical style change from the period before *Insecure* compared to the period after Insecure.\n",

    "On the Voice Memos (2019) album, we can see Quadeca talking about how he 'has to reassess' his identity after the new gained popularity. Additionally, there are other tracks on the album that talk about how he is not your typical rapper and that he is unique. And, from some of the common phrases, we can see Quadeca referring to a man on his shoulder, which is referring to his inner demons and his internal doubts feeding his insecurity. \n",

Here, Quadeca could be referring to having feelings for a girl and her not reciprocating the same feeling. Although if you a deeper look into the lyrics and compare it to the rest of the random sample, one could argue that this line is referring to the relationship between his view on his growth as a rapper compared to his audience's/peers' view on his rapping talents.

This is definitely not the first time that Quadeca seems to be defending himself from the haters and doubters, as we've seen this topic in other concordances before this one. Quadeca seems to use the term `game` in two specific contexts. The first context is whenever he is referring to the rap game, while the second context is usually when he juxtapose life and a game. Lines like `ayy oh oh said i'm married to the game i'm married to the game said i'm married` show his dedication to the rap game and wanting to improve on his craft.

The line `you got a ego tell em thank the fuckin lord cause if you didn't you'd be suffering` seems to suggest that Quadeca's eagerness to prove his value as a rapper and knowing his worth saved him from being swallowed by his insecurities. Another interesting line is `reach this quota for success without sayin a fuckin word yeah if life's a test it doesn't`. This line could be referring to Quadeca reaching a level of success without dropping music for so long (his last project was in 2019, and his most recent project came out in 2021).

    "The term `alone` is being used to describe:\n",
    ">* by one's self\n",
    "\n",
    "> From this random sample of the term `alone`, it seems like there are two main themes that Quadeca talks about. One of which is describing how he felt on his journey to reach where he is at the current moment. This can be seen in the lines `had me wantin to quit i was all alone cause i ain't follow their shit and now`, `kanye in a MAGA hat yeah i'm so alone see i've always been one and only even`, `betray myself i been afraid to tell so alone so i just braced myself i've wanted love` and `the beaten route i thought that life was alone with ice to my bones and nothin i`. The other theme that Quadeca explores with the term `alone` is about a past relationship with an ex-girlfriend. This can be seen in the lines `you're a i guess i'm alone i'll be alone forever yeah together alone i guess we're alone` and `drift drift away you're a i guess i'm alone i'll be alone forever yeah together alone i`. These lines seem to suggest that Quadeca was once with someone and they drifted apart. Now they are two separate entities who are alone, by themselves."

This can be seen in the lines `who else should have your name fall in love until it's not the same if you lose` and `if you remember me you are not in love you just pretend to be drift drift away`. As I mentioned before, it seems like Quadeca was in loving relationship with a past ex-girlfriend, but things didn't work out and they broke up and moved on from each other. Quadeca reflects back on this relationship wondering if the two were just pretending to be in love and trying to make it work. One of the more interesting lines using the term `love` is `the drop though so i don't they only love me when i'm back on the climb yeah`. Here, Quadeca seems to be addressing people that are only interested in him when he's on the music grind and dropping music.  "

It appears that trying to use the keywords to predict the sentiment of the corpus does not help. The next step will be to do a sentiment analysis on each song to see how many positive, negative, and neutral songs exists within each album. From there, I will do a sentiment analysis over the albums, to get the overall sentiment score of each album in each period of time and then compare the two periods of time. Afterward, I will see if the sentiment scores supports the other analyses that I've conducted."

The average polarity score for an album in the before period was 0.053 and the average polarity score for an album in the after period was 0.237. \n",

    "This result is significant for two main reasons:\n",
    "> In the earlier analysis, I found that there were some common themes that were talked about in both corpuses, such as struggling with depression, dealing with public expectations, and talking about past romantic relationships. As a result, I thought that the sentiment scores between the two corpuses would be more or less the same. However, there is a significant difference between the sentiment score of the before corpus and the sentiment score of the after corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    ">From those themes that I discovered that Quadeca was rapping about, I expected more albums to have an overall negative sentiment and that both corpuses would have an overall negative sentiment value. However, it appears that both corpuses had positive overall sentiment values. This could mean that Quadeca is talking about some of these more serious and negative topics and the vader polarity score is misinterpreting/overcorrecting the sentiment of the song. An example of this can be seen in the the after album Voice Memos (2019) song titled \"The Man on My Left Shoulder (a_album_one_lyrics[4]).\" This song is talking about Quadeca and how he's dealing with an inner voice that always points out the negativity in life. This song is definitely a negative sentiment song, yet the vader compound polarity score returns 0.9967, which makes it seem like an extremely happy song when it's not. Another possibility for this result is that the keyness analysis and the keyword in context concordance analysis that I did overestimated the themes that were suppose to be in the albums.\n"
